* Why should you care ?


* Fancy some Microservices ?

- Organized around Business Capabilities
- Smart endpoints and dumb pipes (no complex stateful protocols)
- Decentralized Governance
- Decentralized Data Management
- Cool way to apply good and old divide and conquer
- Different problems can be approached with different technologies
- Great way to explore new languages/ideas with safety
- Service orientation done right


* Microservices tradeoff, no free lunch for you

* For each service you need

- Build an deployable artifact
- Deploy your artifact
- Keep your service running
- Scale (better if it is autoscale)
- Load balance it (if it exposes an API, which usually is the case)
- Expose it to other services that depends on it (service discovery)
- Health check (check if it is actually working, not just running)
- With one service you can survive doing manual stuff
- With microservices it is automation or agonizing death :-)

* Microservices begins with

.image ./img/look-the-languages.jpg _ 700


* And ends with...

.image ./img/deploying-all-languages.jpg _ 700


* Cattle, not pets

- Imagine trying to work with pets when you have 100 different services
- No need to know where each service is running
- Treat nodes as cattle, not pets
- No manual configuration
- No node is "special" and needs individual care
- If it goes sick, just kill it
- If it dies, just add a new one
- They are just a pool or computational resources
- Infrastructure as code is your friend here


* What we want ?

- A way to automate everything
- As little distance as possible between running on the dev machine and production
- Easy way to: configure, scale, service discovery, load balance, health check, rolling update, debug
- Adding new services must be easy (we are going to have a lot of them :-)
- No need to ssh/log into nodes (this should be an exception, not the norm)
- No snowflakes servers
- Easy way to enable multi-tenancy (some teams have this challenge at Neoway)


* The Deployable artifact: Docker

- Self-contained (no hell of dependencies)
- Language agnostic way to package and run applications
- Closes the gap between environments (dev <-> staging <-> production)
- Solves pretty nicely the artifact problem
- But how to run 100 containers through 10 machines ?
- How to connect different containers with each other ?
- How to keep then running even on failures ?


* The Container Orchestrator: Kubernetes

- Scheduling
- Scaling
- Load Balance
- Health Check
- Service discovery


* Kubernetes why ?

- More than just using fleet
- Less than using Mesos/Mesosphere/Deis
- We wanted something more, but that doesn't was a PAAS (remember, multi-tenancy)
- Kubernetes is a CAAS (Container As A Service)
- Just what we wanted :-)
- Cool / Scalable way to extend through REST API
- Great community (Google + Red Hat as top contributors, not bad :-)
- Great documentation


* Datapirates Kubernetes Learning Experience


* Datapirates ???

- Team responsible for capturing data on the internet
- We mainly develop scrapers
- And all the infrastructure required by it
- Breaking captchas
- Fresh proxies to avoid blacklisting
- Storing raw data (rastreability / reprocessing)
- Monitor services + more than 200 bots
- DevOps culture, the team does all operational work


* Context: 2015

- April, started work on new service oriented architecture for bots
- Looking for a way to run our new architecture
- We started working with Kubernetes for this around August, 2015
- Setting up a cluster took less than a day
- Understand the main concepts is pretty fast
- Understanding the networking took almost a week and a lot of drawings on the wall :-)


* Kubernetes concepts very fast introduction


* Pods

- Where your containers will be running
- Each one has its own IP address
- Can have multiple containers
- Containers on the same pod share the same filesystem/network/IPC(Inter process communication)
- You can think on it as a "node"
- If you create a pod and it exits, it stays dead forever
- Enters replication controllers


* Replication controllers

- Replicates your pods
- Keep them running, if a pod dies it starts a new one
- On Kubernetes 1.2 there is the new Replication Set, which is recommended
- We are still working with replication controllers
- Neither pods or replication controllers provides service discovery
- Until now, you have not exported anything
- Enters Services


* Services

- Easy way to do service discovery inside the cluster
- Creates an Cluster IP (more on that later :-) for your service
- The Cluster IP NEVER changes, but pods IPs changes, since they can exit
- Consumers always uses this cluster ip
- This Cluster IP load balances to a set of pods
- The set of pods is defined by the Selector concept
- It will hold a set of Endpoints (each endpoint points to a pod)
- They can also be used to abstract access to services outside the cluster


* Service discovery

- Environment variables
- DNS


* What we needed to deploy

.image ./img/datapirates-arch.png 580 _


* Our full stack

- CoreOS
- Etcd
- Flannel (SDN-Software Defined Network, or overlay network)
- Kubernetes
- [[https://github.com/NeowayLabs/cloud-machine][Cloud Machine]]


* How the cluster is builded ?

- In house tool called harbor, using Cloud Machine
- Why not [[https://coreos.com/kubernetes/docs/latest/kubernetes-on-aws.html][kube-aws]] ?
- Because it didnt existed on the time we started :-)
- It seems to be a good way to start playing with Kubernetes + CoreOS


* Deployment Overview


* Where each service/database is

.image ./img/deployment.png _ 750


* Networking Example


* How a bot reaches a service ?

.image ./img/kubernetes-networking.png


* Basically ...

.image ./img/magic.gif _ 600


* Datapirates final remarks

- Choose a service discovery that works the same on dev/prod
- Do not use docker link env vars, they are deprecating on Docker 1.10
- DNS seems the way to go
- Being able to build entire cluster is 5 minutes was a good way to experiment with different instance types
- No need to knows IPs (or have some cheatsheet)
- Destroying stuff is fun :-)
- Easy to get logs and get inside containers
- Hard to debug network problems (more layers than usual)
