* Agenda

- Why another language ?
- How Go improves on other languages ?
- Concurrency model
- Memory model
- Abstractions 
- Modules
- Testing 
- Deployment


* Why another language ?: The problem

- Need for some serious system programming
- Pretty low level stuff (performance also a problem), so C++ was used
- Huge C++ systems have been developed (at Google)
- C++0x (today C++11) has been presented at Google
- Lot of stuff added, nothing removed
- Far from simple :-(
- Concurrency was a pain in the ass
- Maintaining a large code base was also a pain in the ass


* Why another language ?: The solution

- A language that could do serious system programming
- That has easy access to low level stuff 
- Where performance is not a problem
- If the system grows it can scale (yeah, it is a monolith :P)
- Minimal set of features to enable great software
- Concurrency at your fingertips
- KISS :-)
